# Hello there!

- 👋 Hi, I’m **@anursetiawan**, you may call me **Nur**
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, computers, and technology in general, also a bit of robotics and electronics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on how to become a web developer, also on how to play simple songs on guitar.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning together while doing team projects.
- 📫 How to reach me is by dropping me a message on Twitter.

## Things that I've been working on..:

- Trying to squeeze in half an hour or two, possibly daily, if possible, to slowy crawl through FCC, I'm at the oh so very very very early beginning right now, you can check out my progress at [my dedicated FCC repo](https://github.com/anursetiawan/freeCodeCamp) as I documented my journey there.
- That's pretty much it, until I've got more free time..

Thank you for reading all the way here, cheers 🍻!
